The website provided by Horiseon Social Services Inc. has had its HTML and CSS changed. Its HTML has been changed to make it semantically correct through the additon of more precise element labels, along with changes to its layout structure to make it more streamlined. The CSS has been changed to do away with unnecessary sylings, and it too has also been streamlined to reflect more accuratley the layout of the content of the brochure.
